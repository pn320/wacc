## Wacc compiler

This is a toy compiler for a programming language borrowed from the Imperial College London compilers assignment. It static typing, and all the basic constructs of a language.
It has not been optimised for speed or code generation (although some techniques have been employed), see the docs. This is really a test compiler before I implement a real
programming language using LLVM and proper language support.
