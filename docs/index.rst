Welcome to wacc documentation!
==============================

Wacc is a compiler for a small, fictional language that is a sort of cross between Lua and C. It is written entirely in Python,
and is designed to a toy compiler so it isn't really optimised for speed or anything like that. It is designed to be a learning
experience and a stepping stone for implementing a more complex compiler in the future.

Installation
------------

To run the wacc compiler on your local machine,
run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ wacc
